This is a file that I am putting into a git repository. I will be using it 
to learn some of the basics of git, such as initializing a repository, adding and 
removing files from the repo, and committing changes to git. I thank you for your
time and patience, and I will see you soon. Love, James. 


This is a change to the file, so that I can see what making changes to committed files does.
